  |   Drowning is a short game about a boy who quickly discovers he has     |
  |   depression in his earlier years of high school.                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Walk through a variety of beautiful low-poly environments as a        |
  |   story unfolds about how he learns to live with his inner demon. You   |
  |   will play in the eyes of a young boy starting out high school in      |
  |   year 7, and play through his following years, where he learns that    |
  |   living with depression is like living with someone trying to put      |
  |   you down all the time. Walk through all the beautiful environments    |
  |   with a lovely soundtrack that suits the current mood of the game,     |
  |   and find all the hidden endings.                                      |
